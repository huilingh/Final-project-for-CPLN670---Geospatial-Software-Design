# Identifying Future Urban Growth and Environmental Sensitivity
The full reort and all codes are included in this reop:
- [Full report](../blob/master/Final%20Report.pdf)
- [Google Earth Engine code (in JavaScript)](../blob/master/Google%20EE%20code)
- [ArcPy scripts](../blob/master/arcpy_script)

This is the final project for course CPLN 670 - Geospatial Software Design at University of Pennsylvania, City Planning Department.
The main purpose of this project is to fully utilize the tools introduced in this course, and use the tools to identify and study a specific topic of students' interests, including:
- Google Earth Engine, a computing platform that allows users to run geospatial analysis on Google's infrastructure, and its open database  of remote sensing satellite images;
- ArcPy, a Python package to perform geospatial analysis. In this course, we use ArcPy to build more customized tools and toolboxes in ArcGIS.
